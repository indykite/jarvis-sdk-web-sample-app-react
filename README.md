## Getting Started

### Trial

For a trial please contact [IndyKite](https://indykite.com/trial) to setup and
configure the platform.

This project is using yarn workspace. Which means multiple projects are hosted in the `/packages/` folder.  
The hosted projects are:

- web - Sample JS React App
- web-ts - Sample TypeScript React App
- web-simple - Sample simple html javascript app

### To run this project locally

1. Copy file `/packages/web/.env-example` as `/packages/web/.env` or `/packages/web-ts/.env`

Fill in the variables where the sample app should be connected. Either directly or by providing a credentials file.

```javascript
# Providing values directly
REACT_APP_BASE_URI = "";
REACT_APP_TENANT_ID = "";
REACT_APP_APPLICATION_ID = "";

# Reading values from a credentials file
REACT_APP_INDYKITE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE=/app_credentials.json
```
Note: If using `REACT_APP_INDYKITE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_FILE`, the credential file must added to the `public` folder



2. Run `yarn`
3. Run `yarn web start`

##### If you want to run typescript version:

Run `yarn web-ts start`

##### If you want to run simple version:

Run `yarn web-simple start`

The simple version has env variables hard coded in index.html

### If you want to use local version of `@indykiteone/jarvis-sdk-web`

1. Clone the repository from https://github.com/indykite/jarvis-sdk-web
2. In terminal go to the root of the repository
3. Run `yarn link` or `npm link`
4. In terminal go to folder `/node_modules/` of the specific app package - either
   `/packages/web/node_modules/` or `/packages/web-ts/node_modules`
5. Run `yarn link @indykiteone/jarvis-sdk-web` or `npm link @indykiteone/jarvis-sdk-web`

### If you need to run the app on different port than 3000

1. Go to package.json in the sample package web repo
2. Modify start script under scripts to `"start": "react-scripts start"`
