# Sample React app with Indykite UI-SDK

IndyKite is a cloud identity platform built to secure and manage human and non-person (IoT) identities and their data. This repository contains the JavaScript Library packages for the [IndyKite Platform](https://indykite.com/platform) Client SDK.

This library contains multiple client libraries for each service of the platform:

- Token introspection
- CRUD operations on digital twins
- Change password
- Limited configuration management

You must obtain an API key before you can access the platform.

## Documentation

Visit the IndyKite One Developer Community site for official [IndyKite documentation](https://indykite.one/blog?category=5e3e9297-3451-4b52-91ee-8027dcd1789c) and to learn to use the entire platform for your project.

## Getting Started

### Trial

For a trial, please contact [IndyKite](https://indykite.com/trial) to set up and configure the platform.

This project uses a Yarn workspace, which means multiple projects are hosted in the `/packages/` folder.  The hosted projects are:

- web - Sample JS React app
- web-ts - Sample TypeScript React app
- web-simple - Sample simple HTML Javascript app

### To run this project locally

1. Copy the file `/packages/web/.env-example` as `/packages/web/.env` or `/packages/web-ts/.env`. Fill in the variables where the sample app should be connected:

```javascript
REACT_APP_BASE_URI = "";
REACT_APP_TENANT_ID = "";
REACT_APP_APPLICATION_ID = "";
```

2. Run `yarn`.
3. Run `yarn web start`.

##### To run the Typescript version:

Run `yarn web-ts start`.

##### To run a simple version:

Run `yarn web-simple start`.

The simple version has env variables hard-coded in index.html.

### To use a local version of `@indykiteone/jarvis-sdk-web`

1. Clone the repository from https://github.com/indykite/jarvis-sdk-web.
2. In the terminal, go to the root of the repository.
3. Run `yarn link` or `npm link`.
4. In the terminal, go to the folder `/node_modules/` of the specific app package. Choose either
   `/packages/web/node_modules/` or `/packages/web-ts/node_modules`.
5. Run `yarn link @indykiteone/jarvis-sdk-web` or `npm link @indykiteone/jarvis-sdk-web`.

### If you need to run the app on different port than 3000

1. Go to package.json in the sample package web repo.
2. Modify start script under scripts to `"start": "react-scripts start"`.
